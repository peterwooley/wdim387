		<h2>Quick Note on Critiques</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>In <a href="http://www.albany.edu/faculty/dgoodwin/shared_resources/critique.html">his guidelines on the subject</a>, Daniel Goodwin from the University at Albany, wrote:
				<blockquote>
					<p>The most important thing to remember is that, although we may each be in this class for different reasons, we are all (presumably) striving to make more and better works of art. The old adage "...I don't know about Art, but I know what I like.." is no longer applicable to your mode of inquiry. Yours is to be a rigorous and rich process of taking your work apart and putting it back together&mdash;better than before&mdash;with the help of this lively critical forum.</p>
				</blockquote>
			</li>
			<li>When commenting, start with something positive, then move into the criticism.</li>
			<li>When given a comment, feel free to defend your design decision, but remain positive.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>First Project Presentations</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Assemble your project files:
				<ul>
					<li><code>src/</code> &mdash; Source (Server- and Client-side)
						<ul>
							<li>Or: <code>src.txt</code> &mdash; URL to your Project's Source Control Repository</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><code>docs/</code> &mdash; Generated Documentation</li>
					<li><code>url.txt</code> &mdash; URL to Project</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Zip up and label your files as <code>lastnameFirstname_firstProject.zip</code> or <code>groupName_firstProject.zip</code>.</li>
			<li>Drop your projects into <code>S:\Data\wdim387\week4\firstProject\</code>.</li>
			<li>Each group will present their project. You'll want to:
				<ul>
					<li>Take us through the app</li>
					<li>Show us your favorite feature</li>
					<li>Walk us through your favorite piece of code</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Group critiques will follow each presentation.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Project Retrospective</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What worked for you on this first project (CodeIgniter, jQuery, Ajax, git, svn, etc.)?</li>
			<li>What didn't work?</li>
			<li>What should you start doing or using for the final project?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>The Final Project</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="homework.html">First Project</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Functional Testing</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Functional tests evaluate your app to make sure it works the way the user expects.</li>
			<li>On the topic, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-test.html">Jeff Canna explains</a>,
				<blockquote>
					<p>Functional tests are even more important than unit tests because they verify that your system is ready for release. The functional tests define your working system in a useful manner. A maintained suite of functional tests:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Captures user requirements in a useful way</li>
						<li>Gives the team (users and developers) confidence that the system meets those requirements</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
			</li>
			<li>Within a functional test, you validate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">User Story</a>&mdash;a scenario of use from the user's perspective.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Automated Functional Testing</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>There are many tools for automating functional testing, but my favourite is <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/">Selenium IDE</a>.</li>
			<li>Selenium IDE is a Firefox addon that allows you to create tests by recording your steps (like a Macro).</li>
			<li>Each set of actions becomes a Test Case, which you can put into a Test Suite.</li>
			<li>You can <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2079">download the latest stable version from Firefox Addons</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Selenium IDE</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>After Selenium IDE has been installed, you can fire up Firefox, select Tools &raquo; Selenium IDE, and start testing.</li>
			<li>The Selenium IDE Windows should look like this:
				<p><img src="assets/seleniumIDE.png" alt="Selenium runs in Firefox as a separate window." /></p>
			</li>
			<li>You can create new Test Cases through File &raquo; New Test Case &amp; Test Suites through File &raquo; New Test Suite.</li>
			<li>You <strong>must</strong> save Test Cases and Test Suites to their own file for everything to function as expected.</li>
		</ul>
