		<h2>This Week in Advanced Scripting</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Final Project Week 7 Presentations</li>
			<li>Coding Standards</li>
			<li>Planning with User Stories</li>
			<li>Game Mechanics</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Designing for Mobile Rescheduled</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>We'll talk Designing for Mobile next week.</li>
			<li>Jason Grigsby (<a href="http://twitter.com/grigs">@grigs</a>) will be speaking in Tyler's Web Standards class this week.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Final Project Week 7 Presentations</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Assemble your project files:
				<ul>
					<li><code>src/</code> &mdash; Source (Server- and Client-side)
						<ul>
							<li>Or: <code>src.txt</code> &mdash; URL to your Project's Source Control Repository</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><code>docs/</code> &mdash; Generated Documentation</li>
					<li><code>url.txt</code> &mdash; URL to Project</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Zip up and label your files as <code>lastnameFirstname_week7.zip</code> or <code>groupName_week7.zip</code>.</li>
			<li>Drop your projects into <code>S:\Data\wdim387\week7\projects\</code>.</li>
			<li>Each group will present their project. You'll want to:
				<ul>
					<li>Take us through the app</li>
					<li>Show us your favorite feature</li>
					<li>Walk us through your favorite piece of code</li>
					<li>Tell us what features you'll be adding in the next three (3) weeks.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Group critiques will follow each presentation.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Project Retrospective</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What worked for you as you started your final project? (CodeIgniter, jQuery, hosting etc.)?</li>
			<li>What didn't work?</li>
			<li>What are you planning on cutting or adding to your project?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Coding Standards</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Every language typically has a set of coding standards (or multiple sets) that encourage unambiguous code.</li>
			<li>In the realm of JavaScript, Douglas Crockford keeps <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html">a list of good conventions</a>, the key points being:
				<ul>
					<li>Declare functions &amp; variables before they are used.</li>
					<li>The <code>with</code> statement should not be used. </li>
					<li><code>eval</code> is evil and should not be used.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/styleguide.html">CodeIgniter has its own Style Guide</a>, which contain a few great ideas like:
				<ul>
					<li>Always use the full-form PHP tags (<code>&lt;?php</code>).</li>
					<li>For files that contain only PHP code, the closing tag (<code>?&gt;</code>) is never permitted.</li>
					<li>TRUE, FALSE, and NULL should always be upper-case.</li>
					<li>If a class name is comprised of more than one word, the first letter of each new word must be prepended by an underscore and not CamelCased. (e.g. <code>Super_class</code>)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

				
		<h2>User Stories</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Planning features for a project can be made easier by using User Stories.</li>
			<li>User Stories describe how a user would use a feature of a given app.</li>
			<li>When writing a story, start with "A user can...". For example:
				<ul>
					<li>A user can register for the application with their email address.</li>
					<li>A user can register for the application using Twitter OAuth.</li>
					<li>A user can login using a login form, or through Twitter OAuth, on the same page.</li>
					<li>A user can view the number of people they are following on every page of the app.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Engineering tasks &amp; Acceptance Tests</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>For each User Story, several engineering stories and acceptance tests are created.</li>
			<li>An engineering task describes what the developer will need to do to fulfill the user story.</li>
			<li>An acceptance test is a simple test that can be performed when presenting the user story to prove it works.</li>
			<li>Using the "User can register for the application with their email address" story, the tasks and tests might look like this:
				<ul>
					<li>Task: Create database tables for user accounts.</li>
					<li>Task: Create registration form with necessary fields (email, password, confirmation, terms, etc.).</li>
					<li>Task: Write the PHP to send the form, validate the form, and add the user or reject with an error.</li>
					<li>Test: Go to registration page, fill out form fields and get confirmation of account creation.</li>
					<li>Test: Attempt to register with invalid information and get correct error messages.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Applying game mechanics to web applications</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://twitter.com/amyjokim">Amy Jo Kim</a> of <a href="http://www.shufflebrain.com/">Shuffle Brain</a> gave a wonderful Google Tech Talk on Applying Game Mechanics to Functional Software.</li>

			<li>The Talk is about 56 minutes long, but we want to focus on the section from <a href="http://pwly.us/gamemech"><var>3:19</var></a> to <var>19:21</var>. (<a href="http://pwly.us/gamemech">http://pwly.us/gamemech</a>)</li>
			<li>You can find <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihUt-163gZI">the video on YouTube</a>.</li>
			<li>Let's take the next 30 minutes to watch the <code>16:02</code> section of the video, then discuss the points she highlights.</li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Game mechanics talking points</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What Web apps engage you in flow?</li>
			<li>How can our apps engage our users in flow?</li>
			<li>What webs apps utilize the collecting mechanic work?</li>
			<li>What makes the collecting mechanic so great?</li>
			<li>How can you use Points in your web applications?</li>
			<li>Why is feedback important?</li>
			<li>How do you use exchanges in web apps like Facebook?</li>
			<li>Where do explicit exchanges work better than implicit?</li>
			<li>Where is customization fun for users?</li>
			<li>Where can customization get annoying for users?</li>
		</ul>
